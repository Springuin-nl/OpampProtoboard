# Used tools
- KiCad, I used version 2014-08-05 BZR 5054; any newer version should work just as well.

# Generating output
Use File -> plot; select Gerber as plot format, tick the relevant layers (top and bottom copper, silkscreen, soldermask and the edge cuts layer) and hit "Plot". 

If you've added holes, don't forget to generate a drill file.
